                    <li>They mainly change color in order to communicate or regulate body temperature.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. </li>
                    <li>They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. </li>
                    <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
                    <li>spired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign 'Teddy's bear' and left it in their shop window.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.</li>
                    <li>Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats</li>
                    <li>Like domestic cats, giant pandas have vertical slits for pupils.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
                    <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
